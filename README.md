# Easy 8 bit CPU

This is a design for an 8 bit CPU built from 74HC logic chips.

It is totally just for fun.  I may try to complete it at some point but for now it's only at the idea stage.

The [design](design) directory has a block diagram that is probably the most useful document for explaining how the CPU is intended to work.

One potentially useful component that is (probably) ready for use is a passive backplane design, which is in the [backplane2](backplane2) directory.
