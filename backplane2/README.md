# Backplane

This is a passive backplane for projects (such as 8 bit micros and
TTL CPUs) where there are lots of parallel bus connections that
would be a pain to wire on breadboards.

The idea is that the project can be built incrementally, with
circuit modules prototyped on a small number of breadboards, and
then permanantly constructed and attached to the backplane.

The eventual finished system then uses the backplane to allow
the various circuit modules to communicate.
